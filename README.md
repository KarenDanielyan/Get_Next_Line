## Requirements:

* Repeated calls (e.g., using a loop) to your get_next_line() function should let you read the text file pointed to by the file descriptor, one line at a time.
* Your function should return the line that was read. If there is nothing else to read or if an error occurred, it should return NULL.
* Make sure that your function works as expected both when reading a file and when reading from the standard input.
* Please note that the returned line should include the terminating \n character, except if the end of file was reached and does not end with a \n character.
* Your header file get_next_line.h must at least contain the prototype of the get_next_line() function.
* Add all the helper functions you need in the get_next_line_utils.c file.
* Because you will have to read files in get_next_line(), add this option to your compiler call: -D BUFFER_SIZE=n
* We consider that get_next_line() has an undefined behavior if the file pointed to by the file descriptor changed since the last call whereas read() didnâ€™t reach the end of file.
* We also consider that get_next_line() has an undefined behavior when reading a binary file. However, you can implement a logical way to handle this behavior if you want to.
* Global variables are forbidden.
* lseek is forbidden.
* Develop get_next_line() using only one static variable.
* Your get_next_line() can manage multiple file descriptors at the same time.
